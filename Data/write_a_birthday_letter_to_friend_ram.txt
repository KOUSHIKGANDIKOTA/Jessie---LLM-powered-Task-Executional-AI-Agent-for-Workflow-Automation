Here's a birthday letter to your friend Ram:

Dear Ram,

Happy Birthday to an amazing friend! Today marks a very special day, a day to celebrate the gift of life, love, and friendship that you bring to my world. As we mark another year of your life, I want to take a moment to express how grateful I am to have you by my side.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of sharing countless memories with you, laughing together, exploring new adventures, and supporting each other through thick and thin. Your kind heart, infectious smile, and generous spirit have touched my life in ways that I never thought possible. You're more than just a friend to me; you're a brother, a confidant, and a partner in crime.

As you celebrate another year of life, I hope you know that you deserve all the happiness, joy, and love that the world has to offer. May this special day be filled with all your favorite things, surrounded by loved ones who care about you deeply. May your cake be chocolatey, your gifts be thoughtful, and your memories be unforgettable.

Here's to many more years of friendship, laughter, and adventure together! I promise to be there for you, through all the ups and downs, to support you, to encourage you, and to celebrate with you every step of the way.

So here's to you, dear Ram, on your special day: May all your dreams come true, may your heart be filled with joy, and may your life be blessed with love, happiness, and fulfillment. Happy Birthday, my friend!

With love and best wishes,
Koushik
