Solving a mirror cube is quite similar to solving a regular Rubik's Cube, but with a twist (literally!). Since all the stickers on a mirror cube are reflective, it can be a bit more challenging. Here's a simplified approach:\n\n1. Start by solving the white cross on top, just like you would on a regular cube.\n2. Once you have the white cross in place, focus on solving the white corners.\n3. After that, move on to solving the middle layer, and finally, the yellow cross on the bottom.\n4. To orient the final layer, use algorithms like R U R' U' or R U2 R' U2 to get the yellow corners in place.\n5. Permute the final layer using algorithms like U R U' R' U R U' R' or U' R' U R U' R' U R.\n\nKeep in mind that it might take some practice to get the hang of it, especially since the mirror finish can make it harder to distinguish between pieces. You can find more detailed tutorials and algorithms online to help you master the mirror cube!\n\nHope that helps, Koushik!"
