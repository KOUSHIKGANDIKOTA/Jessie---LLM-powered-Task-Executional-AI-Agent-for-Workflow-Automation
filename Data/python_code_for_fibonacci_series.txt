**Fibonacci Series in Python**
=====================================

The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**Code**
--------

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci series up to the nth number.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of terms in the series.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    fib_series = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_series) < n:
        fib_series.append(fib_series[-1] + fib_series[-2])
    return fib_series

# Example usage
n = 10
print(fibonacci(n))
```

**Output**
----------

```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

**Explanation**
---------------

1. The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of terms in the series.
2. The function initializes a list `fib_series` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
3. The function enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_series` reaches `n`.
4. In each iteration, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in `fib_series` to the end of the list.
5. The function returns the completed Fibonacci series.

**Alternative Implementation**
---------------------------

You can also use recursion to generate the Fibonacci series:

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

# Example usage
n = 10
fib_series = [fibonacci_recursive(i) for i in range(n)]
print(fib_series)
```

Note that the recursive implementation has a higher time complexity than the iterative implementation and may not be suitable for large values of `n`.
